%% *INTRODUCTION* 
% Visualization of metabolite interactions on graphs is a convenient way to 
% trace of metabolites of interest. It provides significant advantages for  detecting 
% produced and consumed metabolites with the help of colourization of edges based 
% on flux values. createMetIntrcNetwork function is a cobra toolbox function for 
% generation  metabolite-metabolite interaction network with given metabolites. 
% If flux values are given, it produces directed metabolite-metabolite interaction 
% network, and It adjust colour and width of edges in the network based on  flux 
% values. The direction of arrows shows produced metabolites. On the produced 
% graph, there is a colorbar that defines which colour corresponds to flux value 
% (see Fig. 1). The scale of colorbar can be defined in order to produce comparable 
% graph for different conditions. It allows to design graph with optional inputs 
% such as node size and colour. Texts of nodes are clickable in the Produced figures. 
% Different functionality was assigned for left and right click; 
% 
% *Left Click*: Generate sub-metabolite-metabolite network from the created 
% figure, this functionality was added for better looking at the created network 
% and showing flux values on edges lines. It is like zooming and adjusting position 
% of clicked node and its first neighbors (see Fig. 2). 
% 
% *Right click*: Generate metabolite-metabolite interaction network from model, 
% this functionality was added for creating metabolite-metabolite interacting 
% network using clicked metabolite and model. It creates new network using clicked 
% node (see Fig. 3). 
% 
% Another useful option is deleting edges based on given threshold value. ( 
% see Fig 4).  The graphs can be created with nodes that has  degree in the given 
% range with the help of excNodesWithDeg parameter (see Section 6).
% 
% 
% 
% *Figure 1* : Succinate and oxaloacetate centered metabolite metabolite interaction 
% network. Colour and width of edges determine based on flux values. Highlighted 
% nodes with green colour represent given metabolites. The network produce using 
% _Salmonella_ genome scale metabolic model (Thiele et al. 2011).   
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% *Figure 2* :Figure that produced with left click on fum[c] in the Fig. 1. 
% It only shows edges and nodes that connect to fum[c] in the previously produced 
% network (Fig. 1). Values on the edges represent flux values. 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% *Figure 3 :* Figure that produced with right click on fum[c] in the Fig. 1. 
% It generates new metabolite-metabolite interaction netwrok using fum[c]. It 
% shows all relationships of fum[c] in the model. Values on the edges represent 
% flux values. 1e-6 represents zero flux since weight of edges cannot be 0 in 
% the matlab graph objects.
%

% 
% *Figure 4* :  Figure that produced with right click on fum[c] in the Fig 1. 
% The edges with 0 fluxes were deleted using threshold optional input. 
%% MATERIALS 
% No materials are needed as createMetIntrcNetwork is a software product.
%% *EQUIPMENT*
% The equipment has to be able to run MATLAB.
% 
% *EQUIPMENT SETUP*
% 
% The COBRA toolbox is required to use the createMetIntrcNetwork.
% 
% *PROCEDURE*
%% 
% Initialise COBRA toolbox, change solver and Load models. 

initCobraToolbox(false) %don't update the toolbox
changeCobraSolver ('gurobi', 'all', 1);
%changeCobraSolver ('glpk', 'all', 1);

% The model is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1507180017#Files 
% (Thiele et al. 2011).  Download the model file in the working directory. You 
% can also use your own model.

% and oxaloacetate without flux values.

% 
% Optimization of the objective function by using the COBRA toolbox  command  
% optimizeCbModel, where the argument  model corresponds to the COBRA model in 
% the MATLAB workspace.

% Another network will be produce if left click on the mal_L[c] on the produced

% one. This plot was added as statically since live editor does not allow clicking 
% on figure in the editor.But if the codes were written in the previous section 
% is run, it will be produced the figure as pop up, and it will be clickable. 
% Figures that produced from main figure also can be clickable with the same properties.

% Generating more clear network via excluding desired metabolites atp[c], adp[c],nad[c],nadh[c],h2o[c], 
% na1[p], nadp[c], h[c],co2[c] and pi[c].

%% 
% As a result, the flux between succ[c] and fum[c] decreases in hypoxia, and 
% it can be seen with looking at the figures.
%% 
% *Section 5:* 
% 
% Generating network with deleting edges based on given threshold value. Threshold 
% value was determined as 0 to exclude edges with no fluxes. After deleting edges, 
% the nodes with zero degree will be deleted.

%% 
% *Section 6:* 
% 
% Deleting nodes that has not degree in a given range. It can be used for better 
% visualization or excluding very employed metabolites.

nodeDegreeRange=[1 50]; % deleting nodes that has lower than 1 degree 
                        % and higher than 100 degree.

%% 
% As a consequence, better network was generated with excluding nodes that has 
% not degree in a given range.

% *Section 7 :*
% 
% Modifying figures. Figures can be produced based on desired design. There 
% is 6 optional parameters for designing figures; 
% 
% *Graphtitle* : Change Title of figure, *nodeColour* : change colour of nodes 
% (it should be RGB triplet see  https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colorspec.html), 
% *Hnodecolour*: change colour of higlighted nodes(it should be RGB triplet), 
% *nodeSize* : change  size of nodes, *HnodeSize*: change size of higlighted nodes, 
% *arrowSize*: change arrow size.

Graphtitle='Salmonella Metabolite-Metabolite Interaction Network';

%% 
% *Section 8 :*
% 
% Creating Metabolite metabolite interaction network with all metabolites inside 
% the model. It can be useful for detecting metabolites that has not interaction 
% with other metabolites, and more advanced network analysis techniques can be 
% perform using produced graph object. 
% 
% graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,model.mets);
% 
% Code was written in text format since matlab live editor cannot produce such 
% big network. Figures were added as static.
% 
% 
% 
% The metabolites that has not interaction with other metabolites can be easily 
% detected by clicking on nodes that placed far from center of the network (see 
% figure below). 
% 
% 
%% 
% *TROUBLESHOOTING*
% 
% The function was written with warning and error messages. The messages are 
% explanatory for troubles (see anticipated results).
% 
% *TIMING*
% 
% The function was written without using loops to increase performance.  The 
% function can be considered as efficient since it can produce graph consisting 
% 1800 node and 6812 edges within 9 seconds in the Matlab editor(intel i5 9th 
% generation,16 GB ram). 
% 
% *ANTICIPATED RESULTS*
% 
% *1.*The function will produce a warning message if the given metabolites are 
% not defined inside the model. But function will produce the network without 
% undefined metabolites.

mets={'succ[c]','oaa[c]','fum[c]','x','y'}; % metabolites of interest.
graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets);
%% 
% *2.*The function will produce a error message if the inputs not properly defined.

mets={'succ[c]','oaa[c]','fum[c]'}; % metabolites of interest.
graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets,'nodeSize','g');
%% 
% 
%% 
% *3.*The function will produce a warning message if there is not edges in the 
% network.

graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets,'excNodesWithDeg',[20 100]);
%% 
% *4.*The function will produce a warning message if scales are given without 
% giving fluxes.

graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets,'scaleMin',0,'scaleMax',10);
%% 
% *5.*The function will produce a error message if scaleMin bigger than scaleMax.

graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets,'scaleMin',10,'scaleMax',0);
%% 
% 
% 
% *6.*The function will produce a error message if excNodesWithDeg are given 
% wrong as minimum degree bigger than maximum degree.

graphObj=createMetIntrcNetwork(model,mets,'excNodesWithDeg',[10 0]);
